# Windows-Artificial-Intelligence-controls-the-Linux-Server-with-Password-Protection.

Python based Artificial Intelligence works under Windows Operating System can Controls 
the RedHat 8 (Linux) operating system through Apache server with Password Protection on
both the Client side and Server Side. By using this, We can easily control the RedHat 8 Linux 
operating system by Speaking with simple English, just like show apache status, restart the 
apache server, restart the firewall and other RedHat commands without knowing the RedHat 8 Linux 
command lines and also we can do some big process like deploying a Docker OS(container), showing 
Docker container list, Delete all Docker containers and much more processes inside the Docker 
server which runs inside the RedHat operating system. So, This Project becomes the stepping stone 
of the next generation people in the field of Advance level of the linux and Docker Automation 
with Artificial Intelligence

METHODOLOGY AND WORKING :-

The following is our proposed methodology and working model of my Project :-

 	-> Firstly the Artificial Intelligence is created using Python Language running in Windows 10 Operating system.

 	-> RedHat 8 linux also is running in the same network.

 	-> My Artificial Intelligence asking for the Password before asking the requirements to do. 
     The Password is checked in both frontend and Backend. If anybody put the wrong password for 
     continuously three times, My System (Windows) will automatically get Logoff itself. 

 	-> By Speaking with simple English, my Artificial Intelligence convert the words into respective Command line

 	-> By using a Apache server, which creates a Path for transferring a Data(commands) between Windows 
     Operating System to RedHat 8 Operating System and vice versa.

 	-> Data from python based Artificial Intelligence is passed to frontend part of HTML, javaScript and AJAX 
     process, then the data can be transferred from frontend to the Backend python coding part running in the Redhat 8 operating system.

 	-> Then the RedHat 8 Operating system, Run the respective commands

 	-> The Output of the all the process can be display in the Web Browser of Windows 10.

 	-> Technologies and Languages I used behind this project is Python for Artificial Intelligence in windows and 
     also Backend Language in Redhat 8 Linux operating System, HTML for Frontend, JavaScript and AJAX for transferring/communicating 
     data between Client and Server side. Apache server is used to creating a path for data transfer between the client and server side.

 	-> By using this same process, We can also control the RedHat 8 Linux operating system running in the Cloud Service. 

 	-> By using this project we can also do many things in field of Cyber Security and  Hacking to do a process easily by 
     simply speaking with my customised Artificial Intelligence.
